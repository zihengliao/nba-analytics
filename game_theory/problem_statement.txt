scenario:
last 3 minutes of the game. you're down 7. 
- whats the strategy that gives you the best chance to catch up and win the game
- do you jack up 3s that have a higher points per 100 possession but huge variance
	or do u jack up 2s and hope for your opponents to miss
- how do you model the offence and defence
- could perhaps do a markov chain/matrix and run a monte carlo simulation
- example could be:
	1. jack up a 3:
		2. miss:
			3. offensive rebound
			4 either jack up another 3 or go for a 2
		5. hit:
			possession ends and opposing teams ball
	6. shoot a middy
		7. miss
		8. hit

for something like this, you can only analyse a team since each team is so diff

could take % of hitting a 3 or hitting a middy be % of what they do per field goal attempt

each simulation run will have to be for what is possible in a span of 3 mins maybe,
would probably have to take the average time per possession
