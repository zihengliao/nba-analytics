klay thompson and nikola jokic have the same logistic regression for game score vs prob of winning.
    - does this mean that they have the same impact? - no.
    - klays game scores are more sparse and on average lower


luka missed out on 20 games. for him to have a 0.6% of winning, his required game score is less than klay and jokic
    - or does this just mean he doesn't need a high game score to impact winning


having a high chance of winning whilst having a low game score could also just mean ur getting carried
    - for example, i consistently have a gamescore of 0 but still have a 50% chance of winning
        - does that mean luka doesn't have that much of an impact (how does him missing 20 games influence this)

the metri you should be looking at isnt the mean, it shoudl be how spread out the graph is
    - imagine someone has high impact, what does that mean? the graph is more spread out (it's moore defined)
        higher game scores will mean higher chance of winning, lower scores mean lower chance of winnign


complications:
- what does impact mean?
- each player has a different logistic regression fitted to them... is that a problem?

the purpose of using log regressoin is to see if there is a direct difference
    - but this is where the correlatoin comes in. if its more correlated, the b1 coefficient term
        will be bigger
    - correlatoin will be different for each player




im trying to make the conclusion that nikola deserves MVP over sga since his stats
have a stronger correlation compared to sga

as in, it's not just who has more points than each other, its the measure of how much this point impacts winning
